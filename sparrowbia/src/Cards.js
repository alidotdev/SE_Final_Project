      <b>History</b>
      <p>
        Sparrowbia, a shopping hub for those who seek to buy the latest in
        fashion. Initially, only men's wear was available at the store, but
        later on clothing for women, children, teens, as well as formal wear was
        also added to the product list as expansion continued. In 2011, we took
        another bold initiative and gave a new look to all our outlets as part
        of our â€˜New Outlook, New Outlet' strategy. This broke the monotonous
        theme of our outlets by making them more modern and different from
        others

      <b>Brand Personality</b>

        flamboyant designs for men and women, we depend on a team of highly
        skilled fashion professionals who come from the country's renowned
